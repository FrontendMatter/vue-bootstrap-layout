## Build
> You can easily build vue-bootstrap-layout yourself.

Our build tool of choice is Webpack. You should have webpack installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g webpack
```

And the build dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

> Any of the following will create the `dist/vue-bootstrap-layout.js` file:

#### Production build
Includes minification and several optimizations:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Development build
A faster build suited for development, with no optimizations and without minification:

```bash
npm run build-dev
```
	
### Watch
Start an initial development build and then FAST continuous incremental builds:

```bash
npm run dev
```
